					<h3>DAY 1: ALICE SPRINGS AND SURROUNDS</h3>
					<p>Surrounded by desert in all directions, Australia’s Red Centre might be one of the country’s driest landscapes.The rugged West MacDonnell Ranges (the West Macs to locals) that stretch almost all the way from Alice Springs to Kings Canyon hide several sensational wild swimming pools in the gorges that bite into the ancient rocky ranges.</p>

					<h3>DAY 2: ALICE SPRINGS TO GLEN HELEN GORGE</h3>
					<p>If yesterday’s serene swimming spots in the West Macs have whetted your appetite for more, hire a car.Head west from Alice Springs on Larapinta Road beyond Simpsons Gap and Standley Chasm to Ellery Creek Big Hole and Redbank Gorge, two more picture-perfect plunge pools encircled by towering walls of red rock. Spend the night in the resort at Glen Helen Gorge beside the Finke River.Glen Helen is around a two-hour drive from Alice Springs.</p>

					<h3>DAY 3: GLEN HELEN GORGE TO ALICE SPRINGS</h3>
					<p>Lace up your hiking boots and hit the trail at Ormiston Gorge on your way back to Alice Springs. The river pool here is one of the deepest in the desert, thought to be 14 metres (46 feet) deep at the southern end, and rarely runs dry.While you can stroll to the water’s edge from the visitor centre in around 10 minutes, the four-hour walk up and over the range into Ormiston Pound and through the gorge is spectacular, and one of the best half-day walks in the Red Centre.  </p>

					<h3>DAY 4: ALICE SPRINGS TO KATHERINE</h3>
					<p>There’s nothing better than relaxing in a natural spa, and they don’t come much better – or cheaper – than the free <b>hot springs</b> in the town of <b>Katherine</b>. Crystal clear and luke warm rather than hot, and surrounded by lush pandanus and monsoon forest, the six pools are a favourite cooling off spot for locals and travellers. You can fly to Katherine from Alice Springs or travel by bus or train, but if you drive you can experience two other spectacular swimming spots an hour south of Katherine, in <i>Elsey National Park</i>. <i>Mataranka Thermal Pool and Bitter Springs</i> are not to be missed.</p>

					<h3>DAY 5: KATHERINE AND SURROUNDS</h3>
					<p>There are dozens of way you can explore the natural wonderland of Nitmiluk Gorge (also known as Katherine Gorge) where the Katherine River carves its way through red sandstone cliffs to form a chain of 13 scenic gorges.One of the most exciting ways to experience Nitmiluk is the helicopter swimming tour that combines a flight over the gorge with a visit to a remote rock pool beneath a waterfall.Spend the night at stylish <b>Cicada Lodge</b> or in one of the <i>safari tents or chalets</i> in the national park. </p>

					<h3>DAY 6: KATHERINE TO LITCHFIELD NATIONAL PARK</h3>
					<p>When it comes to swimming in the wild, it doesn’t get much better than the pools of <b>Litchfield National Park</b>, around a three-hour drive north of Katherine on the way to the city of Darwin. Home to several sublime waterfalls, it’s one of the Northern Territory's best swimming spots. The most popular place to get wet is <b><i>Wangi Falls and Florence Falls</i></b>.You can camp at both Wangi and Florence Falls, or stay in one of the cabins at nearby Litchfield Tourist Park, where there’s also a bar and café.  </p>

					<h3>DAY 7: LITCHFIELD NATIONAL PARK</h3>
					<p>If you’ve got a 4WD, head out to <b>Tjaynera Falls</b> (Sandy Creek Falls), a deep waterhole every bit as gorgeous as Wangi Falls but with fewer bathers, and Surprise Falls, another of Litchfield’s hidden gems where three pools tumble into each other over rock walls. Getting there is half the fun as you wind your way through the Lost City – a forest of sandstone towers formed by thousands of years of wind and rain erosion – and past hundreds of gigantic magnetic termite mounds, all facing north so the inside of the mound doesn’t get overheated by the sun. </p>

					<h3>DAY 8: LITCHFIELD NATIONAL PARK TO KAKADU NATIONAL PARK</h3>
					<p><b><i>Kakadu</i></b>, Australia’s largest national park, is famous for its wild saltwater crocodiles (and its rock art galleries, birdlife, wetlands and buffalo), but don’t let that scare you off. There are lots of places where you can safely swim. Gunlom plunge pool at the top of Gunlom Falls in Kakadu National Park is worth every second of the steep, 45-minute hike to get there.</p>

					<h3>DAY 9: KAKADU NATIONAL PARK</h3>
					<p>If you like your wild pools crowd-free, you’ll love <b><i>Motor Car Falls</i></b>, a magical swimming spot only accessible by foot. Once you’re there, chances are it will just be you and the resident turtles that float about in the shady pool. If you’d prefer a shorter hike, head to <i>Maguk Gorge</i>.Head back to Cooinda in time to join a sunset cruise on Yellow Water Billabong, the best time of day to see birds and crocodiles.</p>

					<h3>DAY 10: KAKADU NATIONAL PARK</h3>
					<p>You can’t leave Kakadu without seeing its most famous cascades, <b><i>Jim Jim Falls and Twin Falls</i></b>. It’s a rough and rugged 4WD track to get there – if you don’t fancy tackling the track you can join a tour from Cooinda – but the drive is worth it. The falls really thunder in the wet season between November and May when the only way you can see them is on a scenic flight.Drive onwards to Darwin, roughly three hours away, where you can look through all your amazing pictures from the comfort of a hotel room.</p>
