					<h3>DAY 1: FLYOVER CANADA</h3>
					<p>The appeal of <b>FlyOver Canada</b> makes the imagined real.During the Ultimate Flying Ride you will see numerous cities and vistas across the country. The production team for FlyOver Canada were able to select 18 scenes from over 100 hours of footage to represent Canada in the ride film. The dream of flight is as old as time itself. Similarly, buried deep in the Canadian soul is the desire to travel across Canada from coast to coast.</p>
